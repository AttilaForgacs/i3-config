# i3-config

My awesome i3 configuration.
Most things are tied into my directory tree but I've tried to utilize variables when possible (usually defined at the top as `$conf`).

Credit where it is due:

- `autoname_workspaces.py` and `util.py` was borrowed / modified and extended
- `/blocks` code I've borrowed / modified
- `compton.conf` was borrowed / modified
- `rofi.conf` was borrowed
- `wacom.sh` and `xsetwacom_my_preferences.sh` was borrowed / modified

The rest of the scripts, configuration, and bringing them all together were done over the years by myself.
Feel free to use any/all of my scripts as you see fit; the way I use it is: `git clone https://github.com/u8sand/i3-config ~/.config/i3` to ready my config.
I may eventually extend this repository over time to address my entire arch setup; for now it's just i3.
